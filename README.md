I have created the files to capture the weather dashboard foro this homework project.

An html file a css file and a js file.

weather2.html
weather.css
weather.js

The weather dashboard allows you to search any country or city in the world. You can view all kinds of data on the weather like: temperature, humidity, wind speed, uv index.

Below the weather overview for the city or country you have searched, the website will nicely display in cards and in columns a 5 day focrecast showing temperature and humidity.

The search function allows you to store your searches as well, using local storage and come back to them with an easy click of the button.
